# stock_price_prediction
This project is about using deep learning, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to predict stock prices based on historical data. Here's a simplified description of the project:

Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This project uses LSTM, a type of deep learning model, to predict stock prices. It's implemented in Python and utilizes the Keras library for creating and training the model. Here's an overview of the project:

•	Data Import: We start by importing historical stock price data from a CSV file.

•	Data Preprocessing: We explore and preprocess the data, including scaling it to a range between 0 and 1 for better model performance.

•	Model Building: The heart of the project is a neural network consisting of four LSTM layers followed by dropout layers. These layers are designed to capture and learn patterns in the stock price data.

•	Training: The model is trained on a portion of the data, specifically the first 70% of the data, to learn how to make predictions.

•	Testing and Prediction: The remaining 30% of the data is used for testing the model's performance. The model makes predictions for stock prices.

•	Evaluation: We compare the model's predictions with the actual stock prices and visualize the results to assess the model's accuracy.

This project is a demonstration of how deep learning techniques can be used to predict stock prices based on historical data.
